# Planet Age

Planet Age is a web app that allows you to check how old you are on each planet.

## How does it work?

What is a day? What is a year?

The earth does not sit still. It is constantly in motion. Actually, it is in
several different motions, all at the same time. The most important ones, which
are also the ones that interest us, are rotation and revolution. Let's define
these two terms:

- **Rotation:** the time that a celestial object takes to complete a full
  rotation around its axis;
- **Revolution:** the motion that a celestial object makes around a center of
  mass.

The earth rotates around its axis once every ≈24 hours, while it revolves
around the Sun once every ≈365 days. These two motions are the ones that define
respectively the length of a day and the length of a year.

Each planet, though, has different rotation and revolution periods, so the
length of a day and of a year is technically different on each of them. Planet
Age uses these values to calculate how old you would be on each planet.

Below you can find a table with the rotation and revolution periods of each
planet in the solar system.

| Planet  | Rotation period (days) | Revolution period (days) |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Earth   | ≈1                     | ≈365.26                  |
| Jupiter | ≈0.41                  | ≈4332.59                 |
| Mars    | ≈1.03                  | ≈686.97                  |
| Mercury | ≈58.65                 | ≈87.97                   |
| Neptune | ≈0.67                  | ≈60182                   |
| Pluto   | ≈6.39                  | ≈90560                   |
| Saturn  | ≈0.44                  | ≈10759.22                |
| Uranus  | ≈0.72                  | ≈30688.5                 |
| Venus   | ≈243.03                | ≈224.7                   |

### What about the Sun and the Moon?

The Sun and the Moon rotate on their axis too, but of course they don't revolve
around the Sun like the planets do.

The Moon rotates on its axis every ≈27.32 days and takes the same time to
revolve around the Earth (which is why we always see the same side of it).

The Sun instead rotates on its axis every ≈25.05 days (on the equator, while it
takes a bit more at the poles), but it doesn't technically revolve around
anything, as it is the center of mass of the solar system. However, it orbits
the center of the Milky Way about every 230 million Earth years, bringing the
planets, asteroids, comets, and other objects with it.
